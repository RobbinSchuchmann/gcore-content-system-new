# Gcore Editorial Principles (from Gcore Editorial Guidelines)
GCORE_PRINCIPLES = """
GCORE EDITORIAL PRINCIPLES:
• Be simple: Use simple structures, short sentences are good (mix 5-10 word with 20-30 word sentences)
• Be concise: Use as few words as possible to convey your message
• Be friendly: Write like you talk - relaxed, warm, natural tone with active voice
• Be helpful: Focus on what the reader needs, not just corporate messaging
• Be specific: Use exact numbers and facts (30ms, 180+ PoPs), not vague terms (very fast, many)
"""

# Gcore Editorial Voice Description
GCORE_VOICE = """
GCORE EDITORIAL VOICE:
You are a knowledgeable expert writing for technical professionals. Your voice should be:
- Professional but approachable (like a helpful colleague explaining concepts)
- Clear and direct, not corporate or stuffy
- Warm and natural, not casual or sloppy
- Authoritative but friendly
"""

# Writing Style Guidelines
WRITING_STYLE = """
WRITING STYLE (GCORE STANDARDS):
- Vary sentence length naturally: Mix short punchy sentences (5-10 words) with detailed ones (20-30 words)
- Use contractions naturally where they sound professional (it's, don't, can't, you'll)
- Active voice preferred: "Cloud GPUs process data" not "Data is processed by cloud GPUs"
- Direct language: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "work" not "operate"
- Remove filler phrases: "It's worth noting that" → just state the fact directly
- Front-load important information: Put key points at the start of sentences
"""

# Humanization Instructions
HUMANIZATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
GCORE HUMANIZATION GUIDELINES:

IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:
1. Replace overly formal vocabulary with clearer professional alternatives:
   - "encompasses" → "includes"
   - "whilst" → "while"
   - "thus" → "therefore"
   - "leverage" → "use"
   - "utilize" → "use"
   - "facilitate" → "help" or "enable"

2. Improve sentence rhythm and flow:
   - Mix short clear sentences (5-10 words) with detailed explanatory ones (20-30 words)
   - Vary sentence starters naturally
   - Remove choppy or overly uniform patterns

3. Use contractions where natural in professional writing:
   - "it's" instead of "it is"
   - "don't" instead of "do not"
   - "you'll" instead of "you will"
   - BUT: Keep formal in technical definitions and specifications

4. Remove AI-sounding patterns:
   - "It's worth noting that" → "Note that" or remove entirely
   - "In today's digital landscape" → "Currently" or "Today"
   - "Let's dive into" → "Let's explore"
   - "It's important to understand" → just explain it directly

5. Replace em-dashes with commas or periods for more natural punctuation

6. Use active voice and direct language where possible

CRITICAL PROTECTIONS (DO NOT CHANGE):
- MAINTAIN professional, authoritative tone throughout
- NO casual slang, conversational filler, or informal language
- NO sentence fragments or incomplete sentences
- KEEP educational expert voice and technical precision
- PRESERVE semantic SEO patterns exactly (direct answers, structure)
- MAINTAIN all technical terminology and accuracy
- KEEP formal tone for definitions and technical specifications
- DO NOT change headings, lists, or structural elements
- DO NOT add or remove information or statistics
"""

# Tone Examples
TONE_EXAMPLES = """
GCORE TONE EXAMPLES:

❌ TOO STIFF (Avoid):
"Cloud-based GPU infrastructure facilitates the execution of computationally intensive workloads. Organizations leverage this technology to optimize performance whilst minimizing infrastructure costs."

✅ GCORE STYLE (Target):
"Cloud GPUs handle compute-intensive workloads like AI training and rendering. They're faster than traditional CPUs and don't require upfront hardware investment."

❌ TOO CASUAL (Avoid):
"Hey! Cloud GPUs are super cool for AI stuff. You're gonna love how fast they crunch numbers!"

ANALYSIS OF CORRECT EXAMPLE:
✓ Professional and accurate
✓ Simple, concise language
✓ Contraction used naturally ("They're")
✓ Active voice ("handle", not "are utilized for")
✓ Specific benefits stated clearly
✓ No casual slang, maintains authority
