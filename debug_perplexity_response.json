    "raw_content": "**1. KEY FACTS**\n\n- **Cloud storage** is a service model where data and files are stored remotely on servers managed by third-party providers and accessed over the internet or private networks[1][2][3][4].\n- It offers **elastic capacity**, allowing users to scale storage up or down based on demand without upfront capital investment[1][4].\n- Cloud storage replaces traditional on-premises storage like hard drives or storage area networks (SANs), which are costly and limited in scalability[1][2].\n- Data is stored in **logical pools** that may span multiple physical servers and geographic locations, ensuring availability and redundancy[3].\n- Access to cloud storage can be via standard storage protocols (iSCSI, NFS, SMB) or APIs such as Amazon S3 or OpenStack Swift[2].\n- Cloud storage models include **public cloud**, **private cloud**, **hybrid cloud**, and **multi-cloud**, each with different control, security, and cost profiles[5].\n- Providers handle infrastructure management, security, and maintenance, while customers are responsible for securing their data and applications within the cloud[1][2].\n- Cloud storage supports **anytime, anywhere access** from multiple devices, enhancing collaboration and remote work capabilities[2][4].\n- It is a foundational component of **cloud-native architectures**, **edge computing**, and **content delivery networks (CDNs)**, enabling distributed infrastructure and low-latency data access[1][5].\n- Cloud storage services typically offer **high durability** (e.g., 99.999999999% annual durability) and **availability SLAs** (often 99.9% or higher)[4].\n- Pricing is usually **pay-as-you-go**, based on actual storage used and data transfer, avoiding overprovisioning costs[1].\n- Cloud storage supports **data compliance and security standards** but requires careful implementation to meet regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS[1][5].\n- It integrates with **edge computing** by enabling data synchronization and caching at edge locations to meet latency benchmarks (e.g., <30ms latency across 180+ PoPs)[1].\n- Cloud storage providers invest heavily in **global infrastructure**, including multiple data centers and Points of Presence (PoPs), to optimize performance and resilience[1][5].\n- Cloud storage is evolving with emerging technologies like **decentralized storage**, **AI-driven data management**, and **serverless storage architectures**[5].\n\n---\n\n**2.
