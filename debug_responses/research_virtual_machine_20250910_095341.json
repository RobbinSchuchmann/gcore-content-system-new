to each VM.[1][2][4]\",\"Each VM has its own operating system and applications, isolated from other VMs and the host, enabling multiple OS types to run concurrently on a single physical machine.[2][3][4]\",\"Key virtual hardware components include virtual CPUs (vCPUs), virtual RAM, virtual hard disks (e.g., .vmdk, .vdi files), virtual network interface cards (vNICs), and optionally virtual GPUs and USB controllers.[1]\",\"Virtualization technology allows a single physical server to host multiple VMs, improving hardware utilization and flexibility.[2][4]\",\"VMs provide isolation, ensuring that processes and failures in one VM do not affect others, enhancing security and stability.[5]\",\"Multi-tenancy is a core feature allowing multiple users or applications to share the same physical hardware securely via VMs.[5]\",\"VMs are portable and can be transferred between different hardware platforms or cloud environments, facilitating scalability and disaster
