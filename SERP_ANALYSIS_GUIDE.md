# Competitor Analysis Guide

## Overview

The Competitor Analysis feature is designed to make SEO content creation accessible to **Virtual Assistants (VAs) and non-SEO professionals**. Instead of manually researching competitors and planning heading structures, you can now:

1. Enter a primary keyword
2. Search Google and copy competitor URLs
3. Paste URLs into the system (3-7 competitors)
4. Get AI-powered heading suggestions based on what's ranking

This eliminates the need for SEO expertise while ensuring your content is optimized for search engines.

## What is Competitor Analysis?

**Competitor Analysis** for SEO means:
- Looking at what content is currently ranking on Google for your keyword
- Analyzing how competitors structure their content (headings, topics covered)
- Using that data to create a better, more comprehensive content structure

**Why this matters for SEO:**
- Google ranks content that comprehensively covers topics
- Analyzing top-ranking pages reveals what Google considers important
- By covering the same topics (and more), you increase your chances of ranking

---

## How to Use Competitor Analysis

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. **Start with Your Primary Keyword**

Enter the main topic you want to write about:
- ‚úÖ Good examples: "cloud computing", "CDN security", "edge computing benefits"
- ‚ùå Too vague: "technology", "cloud"
- ‚ùå Too specific: "how to configure CloudFront cache headers in AWS"

**Tip:** Use 2-4 word phrases that describe your main topic.

---

#### 2. **Search Google Manually**

1. Open Google in a new tab
2. Search for your keyword (e.g., "what is cloud computing")
3. Look at the top 10 results

**What to look for:**
- Direct competitors (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.)
- Authority sites (Wikipedia, major tech blogs)
- Comprehensive guides and tutorials

---

#### 3. **Copy Competitor URLs**

For each relevant result in Google:
1. Right-click the title ‚Üí Copy link address
2. Or click the result and copy the URL from your browser

**Recommended:** Copy 3-7 URLs total

---

#### 4. **Add URLs to the System**

Back in the Gcore Content System:
1. Paste each URL into the "Competitor URL" field
2. Click "‚ûï Add URL"
3. Repeat for all competitors

**The system will:**
- Validate each URL
- Display added URLs with domains
- Allow you to remove URLs if needed

---

#### 5. **Analyze Competitors**

Once you have 2+ URLs added:

Click **"ü§ñ Analyze X Competitors"**

**How to choose competitors:**

‚úÖ **DO Select:**
- Direct competitors (AWS, Google Cloud, Cloudflare, etc.)
- Authority sites with comprehensive content
- Pages with clear heading structures
- Mix of different perspectives (3-5 pages is ideal)

‚ùå **DON'T Select:**
- Your own Gcore pages
- Low-quality content farms
- Forums or Q&A sites (like Quora) unless they're exceptionally detailed
- Pages that are clearly outdated

**Recommended:** Select **3-7 competitors** for best results. Too few gives limited insights, too many creates noise.

---

#### 4. **Analyze Selected Competitors**

Click **"ü§ñ Analyze X Selected Competitors"**.

The system will:
1. **Extract headings** from each competitor page (H1, H2, H3)
2. **Analyze patterns** to find common topics across competitors
3. **Identify gaps** where you can add unique value
4. **Generate AI suggestions** for your optimal heading structure

**This process takes 30-60 seconds** depending on how many competitors you selected.

---

#### 5. **Review AI Suggestions**

Once complete, you'll see:

**üìå Suggested H1:** The main title for your article

**üí° Strategic Insights:** Explanation of why this structure will outperform competitors

**üìã Suggested H2/H3 Structure:**
- Each H2 section with explanation
- Suggested H3 subheadings under each H2
- FAQ section with common questions

**What the AI considers:**
- Topics all competitors cover (must-haves)
- Topics some competitors miss (opportunities)
- Logical flow and hierarchy
- Search intent (what users want to know)
- SEO best practices

---

#### 6. **Use or Edit Suggestions**

You have two options:

**Option A: "‚úÖ Use These Suggestions"**
- Automatically applies the full heading structure to your content brief
- Proceeds to Step 1 (Content Brief) with everything pre-populated
- You can still edit manually in Step 1

**Option B: "üìù Edit Manually in Brief"**
- Moves to Step 1 with your keyword filled in
- You can reference the suggestions while building your own structure
- Good if you want to customize before proceeding

---

#### 7. **Skip SERP Analysis (Optional)**

If you already know your content structure, click **"Skip to Manual Brief ‚Üí"** at any time.

This takes you directly to Step 1 where you can build your brief manually.

## Understanding the Results

### What Makes a Good Heading Structure?

The AI suggestions aim to create content that:

1. **Covers Core Topics**
   - All essential concepts competitors cover
   - Ensures you don't miss important information

2. **Fills Content Gaps**
   - Identifies topics competitors missed
   - Gives you opportunities to rank for additional keywords

3. **Follows Logical Flow**
   - Introduction ‚Üí Core concepts ‚Üí Advanced topics ‚Üí FAQ
   - Mirrors how users naturally search for information

4. **Optimizes for SEO**
   - Uses natural language (not keyword-stuffed)
   - Follows proper heading hierarchy (H2 ‚Üí H3)
   - Includes FAQ section (great for featured snippets)

### Reading the Strategic Insights

The **Strategic Insights** section explains:
- **Why this structure works** for SEO
- **What gaps** you're filling vs competitors
- **How comprehensive** the coverage is

**Example:**
> "This structure combines the technical depth of competitor A with the practical examples from competitor B, while adding a security considerations section that none of the top 10 results cover. The FAQ section addresses 5 common questions that appear in 'People Also Ask' boxes."

## How It Works (Technical)

For those interested in the technical details:

### Architecture

```
1. SERP Fetching
   ‚îî‚Üí Uses Perplexity AI to query Google
   ‚îî‚Üí Returns top 10 URLs with titles

2. Competitor Scraping
   ‚îî‚Üí Fetches each competitor page
   ‚îî‚Üí Extracts H1, H2, H3 headings
   ‚îî‚Üí Handles failures gracefully

3. Pattern Analysis
   ‚îî‚Üí Identifies common H2 topics (appear in 2+ competitors)
   ‚îî‚Üí Identifies common H3 topics
   ‚îî‚Üí Detects FAQ sections
   ‚îî‚Üí Calculates average heading counts

4. AI Suggestion Generation
   ‚îî‚Üí Claude AI analyzes all data
   ‚îî‚Üí Generates optimal structure
   ‚îî‚Üí Provides explanations for each section
   ‚îî‚Üí Suggests FAQ questions
```

### APIs Used

- **Perplexity AI**: For fetching Google SERP results (bypasses scraping blocks)
- **BeautifulSoup**: For extracting headings from competitor pages
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: For analyzing patterns and generating suggestions

### Data Processing

The system:
- Processes pages **concurrently** (5 at a time) for speed
- **Caches** results during your session
- **Handles errors** gracefully (skips failed URLs)
- **Preserves** your selections if you refresh

---

## Best Practices

### Keyword Selection

‚úÖ **Good Keywords:**
- "cloud storage solutions" (specific + commercial intent)
- "how CDN works" (informational + clear intent)
- "edge computing vs cloud computing" (comparison)

‚ùå **Poor Keywords:**
- "cloud" (too broad)
- "best cdn provider 2024 gcore" (too specific + branded)

### Competitor Selection

**Mix your competitors:**
- 1-2 direct competitors (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- 1-2 authority sites (Wikipedia, tech blogs)
- 1-2 niche experts (specialized blogs, documentation)

**Avoid:**
- Selecting only Gcore competitors (you'll just copy their structure)
- Selecting more than 8 pages (diminishing returns)

### Editing Suggestions

**The AI suggestions are a starting point**, not gospel. Feel free to:
- Remove sections that don't fit Gcore's focus
- Add sections about Gcore-specific features
- Reorder sections for better flow
- Simplify overly complex structures

### When to Skip SERP Analysis

Skip if:
- You're an SEO expert and know exactly what you want
- You're updating existing content (use Content Optimization tab instead)
- Your topic is very niche (top 10 results may not be relevant)
- You're in a hurry and have a template ready

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch SERP results"

**Possible causes:**
- Perplexity API is down or rate-limited
- API key is invalid or expired
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes and try again
2. Check your `.env` file has `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` set
3. Try a different keyword (some keywords may be blocked)

### "Failed to scrape X URLs"

**This is normal!** Some websites block scraping.

**Common failures:**
- Cloudflare-protected sites
- Sites with aggressive bot detection
- Paywalled content

**What to do:**
- Don't worry if 1-3 URLs fail out of 10
- The AI will work with whatever data succeeded
- If ALL fail, try selecting different competitors

### "AI suggestion failed"

**Possible causes:**
- Claude API is down or rate-limited
- API key is invalid
- The extracted competitor data was insufficient

**Solutions:**
1. Check your `.env` file has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set
2. Try selecting more competitors (need at least 2-3 successful scrapes)
3. Use manual brief as fallback

### Suggestions seem generic or off-topic

**Causes:**
- Keyword was too broad
- Competitors selected weren't relevant
- Not enough successful scrapes

**Solutions:**
- Try a more specific keyword
- Reselect competitors (choose more relevant ones)
- Use suggestions as inspiration, edit heavily in Step 1

### "No results found for my keyword"

**Possible causes:**
- Very niche keyword with few results
- Typo in keyword
- Perplexity couldn't find relevant results

**Solutions:**
- Try a broader keyword
- Check spelling
- Skip to manual brief

## FAQ

**Q: Does this guarantee my content will rank?**
A: No. SERP Analysis creates an SEO-optimized structure, but ranking depends on content quality, links, domain authority, and many other factors. This tool gives you a competitive starting point.

**Q: Can I analyze Gcore's own pages?**
A: Yes, but it's not recommended. You'd just be copying your existing structure. Better to analyze external competitors.

**Q: How often should I run SERP Analysis?**
A: Every time you create new content on a topic you're not familiar with. For topics you know well, you can skip it.

**Q: Will this show my competitors what I'm doing?**
A: No. The analysis is read-only. You're just viewing public competitor pages, not sending them any data.

**Q: Can I save SERP Analysis results?**
A: Results are stored in your session while you work. Once you apply them to Step 1, they're part of your content brief. The raw data isn't exported separately (yet).

**Q: What if I want to analyze more than 10 results?**
A: Currently limited to top 10. This covers 99% of use cases (most clicks go to top 5). If you need more, contact support.

**Q: Can I use this for languages other than English?**
A: The tool works with any language that Google and Perplexity support. However, AI suggestions are optimized for English SEO patterns.
