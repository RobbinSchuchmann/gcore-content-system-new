<h1>block storage</h1>

<p>Block storage is a data storage technique that stores data in fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address that enables independent data management. The system splits data into equal-sized chunks, typically ranging from 512 bytes to 4 KB, and maintains a lookup table to track block addresses and their relationships. Operating systems interact with block storage through logical block addresses (LBAs), which map to physical locations on storage media like SSDs or HDDs.

This fundamental storage technology serves as the foundation for other storage types, including file and object storage, while delivering consistent sub-millisecond latency for mission-critical applications. Block storage volumes function like individual hard drives that can be configured and attached to operating systems as virtual drives, using protocols such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel to transfer data across networks.</p>

<h2>What is block storage?</h2>
<p>Block storage is a data storage technique that organizes data into fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address for independent access and management. This storage method functions like a collection of virtual hard drives that operating systems can directly configure and mount. Block storage serves as the foundation for other storage types like file and object storage, while its direct block-level access enables consistently low latency performance through protocols such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel.</p>
<h2>How does block storage work?</h2>
<p>Block storage works by storing data in fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address that allows direct access and independent management. The system splits data into equal-sized chunks, typically ranging from 512 bytes to 4 KB, and maintains a lookup table to track where each block is stored.</p>
<p>When an application needs to read or write data, the operating system translates the request into logical block addresses (LBAs). These LBAs map directly to physical locations on storage devices like SSDs or HDDs.</p>
<p>The storage system can then quickly locate and access specific blocks without having to read through other data.</p>
<p>Block storage connects to systems through specialized protocols like iSCSI and Fibre Channel, which enable fast, reliable data transfer over networks. These protocols treat the storage volume like a local disk, allowing applications to write and read data at the block level with minimal overhead.</p>
<p>The block-based approach delivers consistent sub-millisecond latency and high performance for databases and mission-critical applications. This makes it particularly effective for workloads that require frequent random access to data or need to modify small portions of files without rewriting entire objects.</p>
<p>Block storage serves as the foundation for both file and object storage systems, providing the raw building blocks that these higher-level storage types use to organize and manage data.</p>
<p>Its flexibility and efficiency make it the primary choice for enterprise storage solutions that demand reliable performance and direct data access.</p>
<h2>How does block storage compare to file storage and object storage?</h2>
<p>Block storage differs from file and object storage by organizing data into fixed-size blocks with unique addresses, while file storage uses hierarchical directories and object storage uses flat namespaces with metadata. Block storage works by breaking down data into equal-sized chunks that can be accessed independently and reassembled as needed.</p>
<p>Each block acts like a separate mini hard drive that the operating system can directly read and write to using logical block addresses (LBAs). This direct access enables faster performance and lower latency compared to file or object storage, making it ideal for databases and high-performance applications.</p>
<p>File storage adds a layer on top of block storage, organizing files in directories with human-readable names and file-level permissions.</p>
<p>Object storage takes a different approach by treating data as objects with unique identifiers and extensive metadata, making it better suited for unstructured data and web-scale applications.</p>
<p>Block storage's raw performance and flexibility make it the foundation for most enterprise storage systems. It supports critical protocols like iSCSI and Fibre Channel, delivering sub-millisecond latency for demanding workloads. The technology powers everything from virtual machine disks to database storage, offering the granular control needed for mission-critical applications.</p>
<p>When choosing between storage types, block storage excels at structured data and applications requiring consistent performance, file storage works best for shared file access, and object storage handles large-scale unstructured data most effectively.</p>

<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
<p>Users often have similar questions when learning about new technical concepts and processes. These FAQs address core topics including basic definitions, technical requirements, implementation steps, and common troubleshooting solutions to help you find quick, clear answers.</p>
<h3>What's the difference between block storage and direct-attached storage (DAS)?</h3>
<p>Block storage manages data in fixed-size blocks with unique addresses, while direct-attached storage (DAS) physically connects storage devices directly to a single server or workstation. Block storage enables network-based access and sharing across multiple systems, whereas DAS remains limited to its directly connected host.</p>
<h3>How much does block storage cost compared to other storage types?</h3>
<p>Block storage costs 20-30% more than object storage but 15-25% less than file storage for equivalent capacity. Performance-optimized block storage with SSD backing can increase costs by 40-60% compared to standard HDD-based block volumes.</p>
<h3>Can block storage be used for backup and archival?</h3>
<p>No, block storage is not ideal for backup and archival due to its block-level architecture optimized for active, transactional data access. Block storage is better suited for primary storage needs like databases and operating systems where low latency and high IOPS are required.</p>
<p>Triple: [Block storage] - [is not suited for] - [backup and archival]</p>
<h3>What is IOPS and why does it matter for block storage?</h3>
<p>IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) measures how many read and write operations a storage device can perform each second, directly impacting application performance and database responsiveness. Block storage systems with high IOPS (typically ranging from thousands to millions of operations per second) deliver faster data access and better support for transaction-heavy workloads like databases and virtual machines.</p>
<h3>Is block storage secure for sensitive data?</h3>
<p>Yes, block storage provides strong data security through built-in encryption, access controls, and block-level isolation. Enterprise block storage systems offer additional protection through secure protocols like Fibre Channel and iSCSI, plus hardware-level data protection with 99.9% availability.</p>
<p>Triple: [Block storage] - [provides] - [strong data security]</p>
<h3>How does block storage handle failures and redundancy?</h3>
<p>Block storage handles failures through redundant array (RAID) configurations and real-time data replication across multiple physical drives. Enterprise block storage systems maintain 99.9%+ availability through automated failover, hot-swappable drives, and continuous data mirroring between primary and backup storage nodes.</p>
