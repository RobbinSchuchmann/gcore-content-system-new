<h2>How does cloud storage work?</h2>
<p>Cloud storage works by saving digital data on multiple servers across the internet instead of your local device. The data is stored in specialized data centers that contain hundreds of servers with massive hard drives, solid-state drives, and other storage media.</p>
<p>When you upload a file to cloud storage, it's broken into smaller pieces, encrypted, and copied to multiple servers for redundancy. Each piece has a unique identifier, allowing the system to quickly locate and reassemble your files when you need them.</p>
<p>The storage servers constantly sync with each other to maintain up-to-date copies of your data.</p>
<p>The process happens through a simple flow: your device sends data to the cloud provider's servers through an internet connection, the servers process and store the data, and you can access it from any device with proper authentication. Cloud storage systems use advanced technologies like data deduplication to save space and load balancing to handle high traffic.</p>
<p>Your files remain secure through encryption both during transfer (in-transit) and while stored (at-rest). Most cloud systems maintain at least three copies of each file across different physical locations to prevent data loss from hardware failures or disasters.</p>
