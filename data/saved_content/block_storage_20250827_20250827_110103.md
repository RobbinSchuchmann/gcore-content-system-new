# block storage

Block storage is a data storage technique that stores data in fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address that enables independent data management. The system splits data into equal-sized chunks, typically ranging from 512 bytes to 4 KB, and maintains a lookup table to track block addresses and their relationships. Operating systems interact with block storage through logical block addresses (LBAs), which map to physical locations on storage media like SSDs or HDDs.

This fundamental storage technology serves as the foundation for other storage types, including file and object storage, while delivering consistent sub-millisecond latency for mission-critical applications. Block storage volumes function like individual hard drives that can be configured and attached to operating systems as virtual drives, using protocols such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel to transfer data across networks.

## What is block storage?

Block storage is a data storage technique that organizes data into fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address for independent access and management. This storage method functions like a collection of virtual hard drives that operating systems can directly configure and mount. Block storage serves as the foundation for other storage types like file and object storage, while its direct block-level access enables consistently low latency performance through protocols such as iSCSI and Fibre Channel.

## How does block storage work?

Block storage works by storing data in fixed-size blocks, each with a unique address that allows direct access and independent management. The system splits data into equal-sized chunks, typically ranging from 512 bytes to 4 KB, and maintains a lookup table to track where each block is stored.

When an application needs to read or write data, the operating system translates the request into logical block addresses (LBAs). These LBAs map directly to physical locations on storage devices like SSDs or HDDs.

The storage system can then quickly locate and access specific blocks without having to read through other data.

Block storage connects to systems through specialized protocols like iSCSI and Fibre Channel, which enable fast, reliable data transfer over networks. These protocols treat the storage volume like a local disk, allowing applications to write and read data at the block level with minimal overhead.

The block-based approach delivers consistent sub-millisecond latency and high performance for databases and mission-critical applications. This makes it particularly effective for workloads that require frequent random access to data or need to modify small portions of files without rewriting entire objects.

Block storage serves as the foundation for both file and object storage systems, providing the raw building blocks that these higher-level storage types use to organize and manage data.

Its flexibility and efficiency make it the primary choice for enterprise storage solutions that demand reliable performance and direct data access.

## How does block storage compare to file storage and object storage?

Block storage differs from file and object storage by organizing data into fixed-size blocks with unique addresses, while file storage uses hierarchical directories and object storage uses flat namespaces with metadata. Block storage works by breaking down data into equal-sized chunks that can be accessed independently and reassembled as needed.

Each block acts like a separate mini hard drive that the operating system can directly read and write to using logical block addresses (LBAs). This direct access enables faster performance and lower latency compared to file or object storage, making it ideal for databases and high-performance applications.

File storage adds a layer on top of block storage, organizing files in directories with human-readable names and file-level permissions.

Object storage takes a different approach by treating data as objects with unique identifiers and extensive metadata, making it better suited for unstructured data and web-scale applications.

Block storage's raw performance and flexibility make it the foundation for most enterprise storage systems. It supports critical protocols like iSCSI and Fibre Channel, delivering sub-millisecond latency for demanding workloads. The technology powers everything from virtual machine disks to database storage, offering the granular control needed for mission-critical applications.

When choosing between storage types, block storage excels at structured data and applications requiring consistent performance, file storage works best for shared file access, and object storage handles large-scale unstructured data most effectively.

## How to implement block storage in cloud environments?

You implement block storage in cloud environments by configuring virtual storage volumes that act as independent hard drives, using fixed-size data blocks with unique addresses for efficient data management.

1. Select your block storage volume type based on performance needs. Choose between standard HDDs for general workloads or SSDs for applications requiring low latency under 1 millisecond.

2. Configure the volume size and block size settings. Start with standard 4KB blocks for most applications, and set initial volume size with a 30% growth buffer.

3. Set up the network connectivity protocol. Connect your storage volumes using iSCSI for standard networking or Fibre Channel for high-performance requirements.

4. Configure volume attachments to your cloud instances. Mount the block storage volume to your operating system and format it with an appropriate file system like ext4 or NTFS.

5. Implement a backup strategy for your block storage. Create regular snapshots at predetermined intervals and replicate data across availability zones for redundancy.

6. Enable encryption for data security. Apply encryption at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption, and configure encryption in transit for data movement between storage and instances.

7. Set up monitoring and alerts for storage performance metrics. Track IOPS, throughput, and latency to maintain optimal performance levels for your applications.

Close unused connections and unmount volumes properly when not in use to prevent resource leaks and unnecessary costs.
