# What Is Cloud Gpu

What is cloud gpu is a graphics processing unit that operates remotely in a cloud provider's data center and can be accessed over the internet, eliminating the need for local hardware installation. These virtual computing resources provide the same parallel processing capabilities as physical GPUs but through on-demand cloud services.

Cloud GPU computing operates by allocating GPU resources through virtual machines or containerized environments that users can access remotely. The NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU with 40 GB memory represents one of the high-performance models commonly deployed in cloud GPU instances in 2024.

This system allows organizations to run GPU-accelerated workloads without maintaining physical hardware infrastructure.

The primary distinction between physical and cloud GPUs lies in their deployment and accessibility models. Physical GPUs are dedicated hardware components installed directly on local devices or servers, providing full direct access to GPU cores and memory. Cloud GPUs, in contrast, exist as virtualized resources that can be shared among multiple users through virtual GPU (vGPU) technology, offering flexibility while maintaining strong performance levels.

Cloud GPU services fall into several categories based on their configuration and intended use cases.

These include dedicated instances that provide exclusive access to entire GPU units, shared instances that partition GPU resources among multiple users, and specialized configurations optimized for machine learning, rendering, or scientific computing. Cloud GPU scaling can be completed within minutes, allowing users to adjust resources based on current demands.

Understanding cloud GPU technology is important because it provides cost savings of up to 50% compared to on-premise GPUs while eliminating hardware maintenance overhead. This pay-as-you-go model allows businesses to access enterprise-grade GPU computing power without significant upfront investment.

## What is a cloud GPU?

A cloud GPU is a virtualized graphics processing unit hosted remotely in a cloud provider's data center that you can access over the internet without owning the physical hardware. This setup lets you rent powerful GPU computing resources on-demand, paying only for what you use rather than investing in expensive hardware upfront. Cloud GPUs work by allocating GPU resources through virtual machines or containers, allowing you to run GPU-accelerated workloads like AI training, machine learning, or graphics rendering from anywhere with an internet connection.

The main advantage of cloud GPUs is their flexibility and cost-effectiveness compared to physical GPUs.

While physical GPUs offer dedicated performance and full control, they require significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs. Cloud GPUs eliminate these barriers by providing instant access to high-performance computing power that can scale up or down based on your needs. You can access enterprise-grade GPUs like the NVIDIA A100 with 40 GB memory through major cloud providers without the overhead of managing physical infrastructure.

Cloud GPU services differ from traditional virtual GPUs (vGPUs) in their delivery method and accessibility.

Virtual GPUs share physical GPU resources among multiple users on the same system, while cloud GPUs extend this concept across the internet, making powerful computing resources available globally. This approach works particularly well for startups training deep learning models, game developers rendering graphics, or financial firms running complex simulations - all without the need to purchase and maintain expensive hardware. The scalability means you can provision resources within minutes and adjust capacity as your projects evolve, much like how a router manages network traffic efficiently.

## How does cloud GPU computing work?

Cloud GPU computing works by providing remote access to powerful graphics processing units hosted in data centers, which you can rent and use over the internet instead of buying physical hardware. When you request cloud [GPU](/learning/https://gcore.com/learning/use-nvidia-h100-gpu-cloud-computing) resources, the provider allocates virtualized GPU capacity from their physical servers to your virtual machine or container. This lets you run graphics-intensive applications, AI training, or data processing tasks without owning the actual hardware.

The process starts when you select your GPU specifications through the cloud provider's interface.

You choose the GPU type (like NVIDIA A100 or V100), memory requirements, and processing power needed for your project. The cloud platform then spins up a virtual machine with your allocated GPU resources, typically within minutes. Your applications connect to this remote GPU just like they would [work](/learning/https://gcore.com/learning/what-is-dns-how-does-it-work) with local hardware, but all processing happens in the data center.

Cloud providers use virtualization technology to share physical GPUs among multiple users efficiently.

They partition GPU memory and cores into smaller virtual units, allowing several customers to use portions of the same physical card simultaneously. This sharing model reduces costs while maintaining performance for most workloads. The virtualization layer manages resource allocation, ensuring each user gets their guaranteed GPU capacity without interference from other users on the same physical hardware.

You access your cloud GPU through standard protocols like SSH, RDP, or web interfaces, depending on your operating system and application needs.

The cloud infrastructure handles all maintenance, cooling, power management, and hardware updates automatically, so you only focus on running your applications.

## What's the difference between a physical GPU and a cloud GPU?

Physical GPUs differ from cloud GPUs primarily in ownership model, accessibility, and resource allocation. Physical GPUs are dedicated hardware components installed directly in your local machine or server, giving you complete control over the processing cores and memory. Cloud GPUs are virtualized graphics processing units hosted in remote data centers that you access over the internet through virtual machines or containers.

Physical GPUs provide direct hardware access with zero latency overhead, making them ideal for applications requiring consistent, predictable performance.

You own the entire GPU's processing power, memory bandwidth, and computational resources without sharing with other users. Cloud GPUs operate through virtualization layers that can introduce slight performance overhead, and resources may be shared among multiple users depending on the service tier you choose.

Deployment and scaling approaches differ especially between the two options. Physical GPUs require hardware procurement, installation, and configuration processes that can take days or weeks to complete.

Cloud GPUs scale within minutes through software provisioning, allowing you to add powerful NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs with 40GB memory or downgrade to smaller instances based on workload demands without any hardware changes.

Cost structures contrast sharply in their financial models. Physical GPUs demand substantial upfront capital investment, plus ongoing expenses for electricity, cooling, and maintenance throughout their 3-5 year lifespan. Cloud GPUs operate on pay-as-you-go pricing that can reduce total costs by up to 50% for variable workloads, since you only pay for actual usage time without maintenance overhead or hardware depreciation concerns.

## What are the types of cloud GPU services?

Types of cloud GPU services refer to the different delivery models and configurations that cloud providers offer for accessing graphics processing unit resources remotely. The types of cloud GPU services are listed below.

• **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) GPU instances**: These services provide virtual machines with dedicated or shared GPU resources that you can configure and manage yourself. You get full control over the operating system and software stack while the cloud provider handles the underlying hardware infrastructure.

• **Platform as a Service (PaaS) GPU platforms**: These services offer pre-configured environments optimized for specific workloads like machine learning or data analytics. The platform handles infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on developing and deploying your applications without worrying about server configuration.

• **Container-based GPU services**: These services provide GPU access through containerized environments like Docker or Kubernetes clusters. You can deploy GPU-accelerated applications in containers that automatically scale based on demand, making it easier to manage complex distributed workloads.

• **Serverless GPU computing**: These services automatically allocate GPU resources only when your code runs, charging you per execution rather than for idle time. This model works well for sporadic workloads where you don't need continuous GPU access.

• **Dedicated GPU hosting**: These services provide exclusive access to physical GPU hardware in [the](https://gcore.com/blog/black-friday-the-best-time-to-select-a-cloud-service) cloud without sharing resources with other users. You get maximum performance and predictable resource allocation, similar to owning the hardware but without maintenance responsibilities.

• **Multi-tenant virtual GPU services**: These services share physical GPU resources among multiple users through virtualization technology. While slightly less performant than dedicated options, they offer cost-effective access to GPU computing for smaller workloads and development projects.

## Why do businesses use cloud GPUs?

Businesses use cloud GPUs because they provide instant access to powerful computing resources without the massive upfront costs and maintenance requirements of physical hardware. Companies can rent high-performance GPUs like NVIDIA A100s on-demand, paying only for what they use rather than investing hundreds of thousands in dedicated equipment.

Cloud GPUs also offer unmatched scalability that physical hardware can't match. A startup training AI models can spin up dozens of GPU instances within minutes during peak workloads, then scale back down when processing is complete.

This flexibility is impossible with on-premise hardware where you're stuck with fixed capacity.

The cost savings are substantial too. Businesses can save up to 50% compared to owning physical GPUs when you factor in electricity, cooling, maintenance, and hardware replacement costs. Plus, cloud providers handle all the technical infrastructure, software updates, and security patches automatically.

For companies running machine learning workloads, graphics rendering, or data analytics, cloud GPUs eliminate the guesswork of capacity planning while providing access to the latest GPU technology without constant hardware upgrades.

## When should you use cloud GPUs?

You should use cloud GPUs when your project requires GPU computing power but you can't justify buying expensive hardware upfront. This becomes critical when training machine learning models, running AI workloads, or processing graphics-intensive tasks that would take weeks on regular CPUs.

Cloud GPUs make sense when you need flexible scaling - like ramping up from 1 to 100 GPUs for a training job, then scaling back down. They're perfect for startups and researchers who need NVIDIA A100 or H100 access without the $10,000-40,000 per unit cost.

You should choose cloud GPUs when your workloads are sporadic or seasonal.

If you only run GPU tasks 20% of the time, paying hourly rates beats owning idle hardware. They're also ideal when you need different GPU types for different projects - you can switch from gaming GPUs for rendering to tensor-optimized GPUs for AI training.

Consider cloud GPUs immediately if you're prototyping, doing proof-of-concepts, or running short-term projects. The ability to spin up resources in minutes and pay only for usage hours makes them perfect for experimentation and development phases.
