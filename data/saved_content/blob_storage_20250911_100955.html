    <h1>Blob Storage</h1>
    <p>Blob storage is a type of object storage designed to handle massive amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, video, audio, and binary data. This cloud-based solution delivers 99.999999999% durability, ensuring extremely high data reliability for enterprise applications.</p>
    <p>The core architecture of blob storage centers on serving content directly to web browsers and supporting distributed file access across global networks. Major cloud providers design these systems to handle streaming media, log file storage, and complete backup solutions for disaster recovery scenarios.</p>
    <p>Users can access stored objects worldwide through HTTP/HTTPS protocols using REST APIs and client libraries.</p>
    <p>Blob storage operates as a specialized form of object storage, where data exists as discrete objects paired with descriptive metadata. This approach differs from traditional file or block storage systems by focusing on flexibility and unstructured data management. The system supports advanced protocols including SSH File Transfer Protocol and Network File System 3.0 for secure, mountable access.</p>
    <p>Storage tiers provide different performance and cost options, with hot tier storage starting at approximately $0.018 per GB for the first 50 TB monthly.</p>
    <p>Archive tiers offer lower costs but require up to 15 hours for data rehydration when moving content back to active storage levels. These tiers include hot, cool, and archive options, each optimized for specific access patterns and retention requirements.</p>
    <p>Understanding blob storage becomes critical as organizations generate exponentially growing volumes of unstructured data that require reliable, flexible storage solutions accessible from any location worldwide.</p>
    <h2>What is blob storage?</h2>
    <p>Blob storage is a type of cloud-based object storage service designed to store massive amounts of unstructured data such as images, videos, documents, backups, and log files. Unlike traditional file or block storage systems, blob storage organizes data as discrete objects with metadata, making it highly flexible and accessible from anywhere via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. This storage method excels at serving media content directly to browsers, supporting data archiving, and enabling distributed access across global applications. Modern blob storage platforms offer multiple access tiers that automatically improve costs based on how frequently you access your data, with hot tiers for active content and archive tiers for long-term retention.</p>
    <h2>How does blob storage work?</h2>
    <p>Blob storage works by storing unstructured data as discrete objects in containers within a flat namespace, accessible through REST APIs and HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Unlike traditional file systems that organize data in hierarchical folders, blob storage treats each piece of data as an independent object with its own unique identifier and metadata.</p>
    <p>When you upload data to blob storage, the system breaks it into objects called "blobs" and assigns each one a unique URL for global access. The storage platform organizes these blobs within containers, which act as top-level groupings similar to buckets.</p>
    <p>Each blob contains the actual data plus metadata that describes properties like content type, creation date, and custom attributes you define.</p>
    <p>The system operates on three main blob types optimized for different use cases. Block blobs handle large files by splitting them into manageable blocks that can be uploaded in parallel, making them perfect for media files and backups. Append blobs allow you to add data to the end of existing files, which works well for logging scenarios.</p>
    <p>Page blobs provide random read/write access and support virtual hard disk files.</p>
    <p>Blob storage platforms typically offer multiple access tiers to improve costs based on how frequently you access your data. Hot tiers serve frequently accessed content with higher storage costs but lower access fees. Cool tiers reduce storage costs for data you access less than once per month.</p>
    <p>Archive tiers provide the lowest storage costs for long-term retention, though retrieving archived data can take several hours.</p>
    <h2>How does blob storage relate to object storage?</h2>
    <p>Blob storage relates to object storage by being a specific type of object storage service designed for storing massive amounts of unstructured data like images, videos, documents, and backups. Both blob storage and object storage share the same core architecture where data is stored as discrete objects with metadata, rather than in traditional file hierarchies or block-level structures.</p>
    <p>Object storage works by organizing data into containers or buckets, with each object having a unique identifier and associated metadata. Blob storage follows this same pattern but adds specific optimizations for web-scale applications and cloud environments.</p>
    <p>It's designed to serve content directly to browsers, support streaming media, handle log files, and manage backup operations through HTTP/HTTPS protocols.</p>
    <p>The key connection is that blob storage implements object storage principles while adding enterprise-grade features like multiple access tiers for cost optimization. Hot tiers serve frequently accessed data. Cool tiers handle monthly access patterns, and Archive tiers store long-term backups at reduced costs. This tiered approach allows organizations to balance performance needs with storage expenses.</p>
    <p>Both storage types use REST APIs and support multiple programming languages including .NET. Java. Python, and Node.js for application combination.</p>
    <p>They also provide global accessibility and can scale to handle petabytes of data across distributed systems, making them ideal for modern cloud applications that need flexible, flexible storage solutions.</p>
